/* Setting a latency budget globally for now, though it could be done per-publisher as well. Packets will go out when full or when LATENCY_BUDGET milliseconds passed since we started filling it. Setting it to 0 will disable packing of data messages, setting to INF only stops packing when the MTU is reached and generally requires explicit flushing. Both edge cases eliminate the latency budget handling and state from the code, saving a whopping 4 bytes of RAM!  */
